# little manual for helping generating voices

 * Voices have been generated using : 
- festival TTS (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival)
or
- espeak TTS (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
and
- US1 MBROLA voice (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/mbrola.html)

=*= Using festival =*=

 * ~/.festivalrc
(Parameter.set 'Audio_Method 'linux16audio)
;; (set! voice_default 'voice_rab_diphone)
;; (set! voice_default 'voice_don_diphone)
(set! voice_default 'voice_us1_mbrola)

 * Command line : text2wave file.txt -o output.wav
(from the Festival toolbox)

 => /!\ edit and USE make_building_voices.sh /!\

 * You can use Audacity to correct sounds :
(verify : bitrate = 16bits, sample rate = 22k)
-> apply Compressor effect with Threshold = -14dB, ratio = 2:1, attack = 0,2s, normalize to 0 selected

=*= Using espeak =*=

 * first install mbrola bin in /usr/local/mbrola (with a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin)
 * then install needed voices in /usr/local/share/mbrola/voices/ (create dir, if necessary)
 * See http://espeak.sourceforge.net/mbrola.html for more informations

 * then use espeak+mbrola.sh or other scripts using espeak
